            <p><span style="color:darkred;font-size:28px;font-weight:bold;">PUSHPA</span> In the 1990s, Pushpa Raj, a labourer, decides to smuggle red sandalwood, a rare wood in high demand that only grows in the Seshachalam Hills of the Chittoor district in Andhra Pradesh with his friend sidekick Kesava. When DSP Govindappa and his team raid the forest for apprehending the coolies and seize the stock, Pushpa hides it, gets arrested and brutally beaten for revealing the location of wood. Pushpa's employer, smuggler Konda Reddy and his brothers bail Pushpa out for the stock's location and he eventually rises through the ranks by suggesting novel ideas to smuggle the stock earning Konda Reddy's trust and becoming his 5% partner, while also simultaneously receiving hatred from Konda Reddy's youngest brother Jolly Reddy.

                Managalam Srinu, Konda Reddy's boss and a big criminal known for his cruelty and oppression, manages the syndicate and entrusts Konda Reddy to keep 200 tons of his contraband safe from the Police Department. As Jolly Reddy is deemed incompetent for task, Pushpa is assigned to do the same. Jolly Reddy intentionally delays the export of wood putting Pushpa in a perplexed condition as Govindappa is about to raid the place. Pushpa throws all the logs into a nearby river while Kesava bribes the chief engineer of the neighboring dam to close its gates preventing the logs from flowing and Govindappa gains nothing with the raid for second time. Srinu hosts a party on this occasion and during the festivity, Pushpa overhears the conversation of two people discussing Srinu's scams and realizes that he sells wood at much higher price than what they are paid. He informs it to Konda Reddy suggesting him to demand a fair share from Srinu but gives up when going against a highly influential Srinu seems risky.</p>

He informs it to Konda Reddy suggesting him to demand a fair share from Srinu but gives up when going against a highly influential Srinu seems risky.While Pushpa is at his prime, Bhanwar Singh Shekawat, an egoistic police officer, takes charge as the district's SP. Pushpa offers a bribe to Bhanwar for cooperation but Bhanwar ridicules Pushpa for his parents' story and his motives for that are to make Pushpa call him "sir". After this incident, Pushpa turns meek and submissive towards Bhanwar, who regularly receives bribes from him. Pushpa, on the day of his marriage spends partying with Bhanwar alone where he converses about the past incident and Bhanwar's humiliating conduct. Pushpa seizes Bhanwar's gun and forces him to be semi-naked while Pushpa also does the same, intending to explain that he is the same without clothes while Bhanwar is nothing without his uniform and even his pet dog would not identify him. Pushpa returns to the wedding hall while an insulted Bhanwar walks home, semi-naked, and his dog fails to identify him without uniform. Enraged, Bhanwar kills the dog and burns the bribe sent by Pushpa, swearing revenge. Pushpa marries Srivalli and tells her that the actual story has just begun.</p>
